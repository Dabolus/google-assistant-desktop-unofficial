## Features
These are the features that I intend to implement. The checked ones are the 
ones that have already been implemented:

- [x] Simple text messaging with the Assistant
- [ ] Audio communication with the Assistant
- [ ] Rich responses
- [ ] Continuous conversations
- [ ] Hotword detection (OK Google, Hey Google, custom hotwords)
- [ ] Assistant language switching
- [x] Dark theme
- [x] Automatic theme switching based on system theme
- [ ] Manual theme swtiching through settings

_These are the currently planned features, but more might come later on. If you 
have an idea for a feature, open an issue so that it can eventually 
be added here._
