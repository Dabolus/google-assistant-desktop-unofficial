The software uses Google Assistant APIs to allow users to interact with the Assistant from devices that otherwise won't be able to use it. This means that, unlike the official Google products, the software might incur some limitations applied by Google itself. The authors do their best to provide the most straightforward and easiest possible interaction with the Google Assistant APIs to the end-users, but as humans, they can make errors. Expect to find some bugs in the product, especially in its initial phase of development. Also, to give full transparency to the end-users, the authors decided to make the software open source. This means that the end-users are free to browse the source code of the software and to eventually compile the source code and contribute to the development of the software itself.
